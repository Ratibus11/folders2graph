# Folders to Graph

> Combine your folder structure into your graphs

This following is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin which allows you to display your vault folder structure into
your graphs.

## How does it works?

By enabling this extension, all you graphs will add your vault folder structure into their view. Really usefull if you
use folders to structure your notes.

## How to use it?

Nothing more easier:

-   Go on Obsidian, then click on the `Settings` button on the left-bottom corner,
-   Go to `Community plugins` tab,
    -   If needed, enable them by clicking on `Turn on community plugins`,
-   Click on `Browse`, then search `Folders to Graph`,
-   Download the plugin, then enable it.

### Want to install it manually?

-   Go on the [repo releases tab](https://github.com/Ratibus11/folders2graph/releases),
-   Download the release you want,
-   Go to your vault plugins folder (eg. `/path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugin`),
-   Finally, extract the downloaded zip content here,

## Roadmap

(Let's check if it's possible)

-   Allow to enable/disable the extension independently of each graph.
-   Create custom nodes to recognize folders nodes independently from the others.
